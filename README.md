# Customer-Churn-Predictive-Model
A predictive model to forecast if a particular customer will churn or not based on recent activity and other metrics.

Problem Statement: Predict which users of an e-commerce startup are likely to churn

Approach:

Used Python to clean data (missing values, incorrect data types) and performed feature engineering using correlation

Compared logistic regression and random forest models 

Random forest model performed better in predicting on training data set which user is more likely to churn

Outcome:

78% precision and 80% recall of the model with decent accuracy on the testing data set of the predictive model

Retention marketing strategy optimized and refocused towards users who are likely to churn
